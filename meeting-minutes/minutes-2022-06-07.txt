** Review draft technical policies

No new policy drafts to discuss.

** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

No new OTC hold issues except for QUIC design overview which we have agenda
item for.

** QUIC design overview

The high level overview of QUIC design was presented by Tomas.
https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/18406

OTC confirms that the design looks OK and we will continue working on the
individual components.
Proposed: Matt, Seconded: Tomas

** Return values and typedefs

We are waiting for volunteer to create a proposal.

Probably the best path for the proposal to be acceptable is to review existing
usage of various return value types and see how the new proposal could
clarify it and accommodate it at least partially. We probably will not want
to apply this to existing code right away but gradually it would make sense
to apply it even to the old code.

AI: Matt to create a proposal on return values and return value types for new
code.

** AOB

We discussed a potential security issue.

The platform policy is somewhat hidden on the openssl website. The reason is
that it needs to be converted into a proper general policies entry in the
general-policies repository.

Discussed a topic of assembler code contributions for platforms that are not
among the primary supported platforms.

We could recommend the contributor to enable the CI run with qemu on the PR
with a temporary commit.
