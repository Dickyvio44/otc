** Discuss the Branch Policy proposal (technical policy PR #7)

Long discussion about different approaches that could be taken. The problem that
we have right now is PRs that aren't suitable for 3.1 but have nowhere to go. It
could be useful to have a "next-minor" and "next-major" release development
branch. We do not need feature branches right now. We may need them when we have
time-based releases where the feature is "big".
AI: Tomáš to refresh the policy proposal to tackle the problem that we have now.

** Review draft technical policies

PR#18: Documentation policy
AI: Everyone to provide any final comments
AI: Paul to start the vote on 3rd Feb

PR#21: Code style policy update
Remove the "enumerated arguments" phrase.
AI: Pauli to start the vote on code style policy update on 9th Feb

** Discuss the Technical requirements document

Discussion about performance being "comparable with other major implementations".
This needs to be more specific. We are not aiming to be the fastest. We should
state what we are testing against and what "comparable" means.
The internal architecture should not prevent the future introduction of a public
facing "single copy" API.

AI: Matt to separate out the requirements in the Technical Requirements document
    into the releases they are relevant for.
