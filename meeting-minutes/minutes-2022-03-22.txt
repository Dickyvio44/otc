Agenda for the meeting agreed. Proposed: Matt, seconded: Tim, Tomas

** Agree minutes from previous meeting

Last week minutes were approved.
Proposed: Tomas, seconded: Matt

** Review outstanding actions

AI: Hugo to repeat the tests in 15199 and get new performance figures.
Done

AI: Matt to do adjustments on the QUIC technical requirements document:

 - to add 6 month releases, and internal CI for primary platforms as objectives
   to the document. Also explicitly mention that in MVP for the next release the
   pluggable record layer interface will be internal.
 - to mention the internal plumbing should allow for the fact that we may want
   to be able to support single copy APIs in future. In addition to the existing
   interface. And put the existing "single copy" bullets under it.
   The performance comparability should be aimed at a future release.
 - to add 'Support' to the last bullet of MVP requirements.
 Done

AI: Matt to update the document and start a vote after two days unless there
is a major discussion ongoing on the PR.
In Progress


** Review the QUIC API proposal

The current proposal does not cover what the API will look like in 3.1 for the
MVP.

Discussion around how we would handle timer based events in the "simple one line
change" to an application for MVP. Possibly with a thread. We will have both
the ability to run timer events via a thread AND the ability to run via idle
callback.

We need some way of hiding the differences between the TCP socket and UDP socket
creation.

How will we do blocking?

How do we work without a visible event capability for existing applications?

Discussion about being able to configure which protocol we want via a string.

AI: Update the QUIC API proposal with approach to solving the 5 problems
(1) timer based events (2) TCP vs UDP socket creation (3) blocking (4) no visible
event capability for existing apps (5) configure protocol via a string.

AI: Separate out in the API proposal the subset we will implement for MVP.

AI: Matt to extend out the description of SSL_new_stream() to make it clearer that
in the TLS context it creates a new connection.

Discussion about the need for good demos and documentation for QUIC.

** Discuss release requirements policy (technical-policies #22)

Requirement is to take the existing text (see technical-policies #22 and main
repo #15326)
AI: Tomas to write a draft release requirements policy in the next sprint

** Performance

Tim provided some links on peformance:

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-banks-quic-performance
https://microsoft.github.io/msquic/index.html#hardware


** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

#17931 (lh stats) Discussion about whether this is ok for master. Proposal that
we could remove the hash counting code completely.
OTC decision is to always report 0 for the stats in both master and 3.0. In
addition we should deprecate the functions in master.
