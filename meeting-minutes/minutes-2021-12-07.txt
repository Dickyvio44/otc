** Nominate a minute taker and confirm agenda

Matt has been volunteered to take the minutes

Agenda for the meeting agreed. Proposed: Tim, seconded: Matthias, Pauli

Last week minutes were approved.
Proposed: Richard, seconded: Tomas

** Review outstanding actions

OTC requests that the OMC provides the OTC with advance notice of future
release requirements and policy updates to allow the OTC to comment (or at
least be aware of updates) before they are public.
AI: Matthias to e-mail the request to OMC.
[done]

AI: Staff to create the PRs for the design choices on QUIC API and on the event
loop.
[done]

AI: Staff to create a blog post to announce these PRs to get community input on
them.
[done]

AI: Tomas to create the label and put it on PRs previously identified by Nicola.
[done]

AI: Everyone to put the label on any other substantial feature PRs.


** Review issues with OTC hold (20 minutes)

PR16450: Not a bug fix so not elgibile for backport to 3.0

PR16705: Vote held, this can be backported to 3.0


** Coverage discussion

Shane stated that PRs are going in without having associated tests. Some
discussion around how we could test malloc failures to increase coverage.
PRs should have tests, including PR16705.

Shane asked is it possible to run the coverage so that it doesn't take an hour.

Tim asked is there something that we could do to get better coverage feedback,
e.g. per PR.

AI: Matt to write a draft test policy

** Can we do anything with file load performance regression

Dmitry stated that file load performance has regressed since 1.1.1 due to
having a more generic architecture and design.

Some discussion about having automated performance testing.

We have some things that we could measure now (e.g. openssl speed). We should
start doing this.

AI: Matt to include in the draft test policy some identification of components
that we should automatically measure performance of

AI: Design team to start collecting technical requirements document - including
quic performance


** QUIC API and event loop design choices

OTC require there to be an external event loop, and it must be part of the MVP.
We may add our own event loop at some later time, but it is not a requirement
for MVP. Blocking and non-blocking support are required for MVP.

Can we make the simplifying assumption that threads are required for QUIC, i.e.
QUIC won't work on a no-threads platform?

The above items should be captured in the design documents for public feedback.


** Allocation of tasks to staff

Perform actions as identified above. Remaining time to be spent on design.

** Agree agenda for next meeting

second two points in the design document.
