** Release discussion

[Shane joined the call]

- We are ready to proceed with the release.
- The two-week prenotification period worked well.

** Review outstanding security issues

We discussed outstanding security issues.

** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

#19199: CMS_add0_cert: if cert already present, do not throw error but ignore it
    OTC: This is OK for master if testcase is added and it has a CHANGES.md entry.

#19989: Add support for mandating use of EMS in TLS 1.2
    OTC: We are OK with adding this feature off by default to 3.1 before the final release.

#20043: remove aes_x86core.c as it is unused
    OTC: We want to make the code built and maintained.

#20098: fix various instances of unsafe sk_find usage
    OTC: this should not be merged as is. We should go through each
    instance and decide which approach to take (pre-sort or locking
    or fallback to linear search)

** Review draft technical policies

#58: New design policy proposal
    Anyone interested should read the new design policy proposal
