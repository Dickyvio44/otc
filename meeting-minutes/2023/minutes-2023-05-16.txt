- ossl_ech_make_echconfig should be public (capitalised)
    - Greasing
    - How are buffer lengths determined?
      - Separate function to determine ECHConfig length ahead of time?
      - or pass NULL for pointers to get lengths? <== API consistent with OpenSSL

- openssl ech command

- On-disk format: combined public/private key, or separate like BoringSSL?

- enable_file/enable_dir v. enable_buffer
  Tradeoff between more APIs v. less APIs and ease of use
  ~100 lines of code for a server if we don't provide the former

  - We usually do not change SSL_CTX state after starting to use it for
    connections; this is OK but we should be aware of the locking issues.

- for_retry argument: probably should be a separate setter call

- flush_keys: s/unsigned int/reasonable fixed size integer/

- Split mode: design should be code, waiting on suitable testing (HAProxy
  issues)
    - SSL_CTX argument used only for storing ECH keys
    - The current API requires buffering an entire CH and is unusual
      relative to our current SSL object design; probably needs changing
    - Handling of split mode doesn't need to be part of an MVP

- Client-side APIs: Similar design to DANE, we do not do DNS lookups,
    application responsible for providing ECH config.
    Does it make sense to set an ECHConfig on a SSL_CTX rather than SSL?
    - Should CTX version be dropped? Maybe
    - Should API be more minimal?

- ossl_ech_find_echconfigs: should DECODER be used? EVP?
    - Non-essential function
    - Should non-essential functions be deferred?
    - Make ECH easier to use in a subsequent PR

- SSL_ech_set_server_names
    - no_outer: flags argument?

- SSL_ech_get_retry_config
    - clarify lifetime of blob

- OSSL_ECH_INFO
    - Concerning about this being a public structure
    - This will probably change later, so it being public is a problem

- Reducing to a minimal viable API without helper functions
  would be a valuable place to start. We can add helpers later.

- Likely we need new object types.

- Should we have more meetings for ECH specifically?

** OTC F2F meeting agenda

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EHyrFzmWX6F6pLlHQtdg9fN58--mKrTc-NqSWJgdkkI/edit#gid=0

Tomas has started structuring the conference.

AI: All to respond to Tomas's requests for agenda scheduling information

The agenda is quite full at this time.

** Provider user/developer group meeting

We have a lot of responses to the proposal for a provider meeting.

We will need multiple meetings.

What should the structure of the meetings be?

There needs to be some degree of planning for the meetings.

=> 15 minute proposals on a set of topics about providers in different areas
   with different presenters?
=> Meetings & presentations will have to be repeated due to time zones.
=> Each meeting will be a couple of hours. Probably two hours.
=> Probably record each meeting.

AI: Anton to identify a shepard to arrange provider meetings

** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

Locking performance enhancements:
    Should we be backporting locking related changes?
    Are there concrete measured benefits?

    => Merge to master for now and we can backport
       separately if we identify concrete benefits to doing
       so at a later time.

Tidy up aarch feature detection code in armcap.c (#20948)
    OTC: This is major refactoring of the CPU feature detection
         code. We are not inclined to merge this to 3.1 unless this
         is having a major impact.

** Review outstanding security issues

We discussed outstanding security issues.

** Review draft technical policies

None to discuss.
