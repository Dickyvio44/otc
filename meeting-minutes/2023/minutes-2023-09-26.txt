** Beta discussion

Multi-stream failures issue is outstanding. We should do another alpha release
as soon as possible.

** Redhat FIPS PRs (Dmitry)

RSA  - 21926. Updates to include various length checks and other misc updates.
Needs some updates for style and to remove things which are unacceptable.

We would like all of the fixes eventually.

Selftest - 21928. No concerns in principle but there are review issues to be
resolved.

Hardening - 21929. PCTs and zeroization of public data. We don't want either of
these at the moment. Minimal password length: we don't want this either at this
time.

** ICMC report

ICMC presentation is here:

We met some companies that were interested in the QUIC implementation.

People expressed an interest in having PQC algs in OpenSSL.

There were questions about the next LTS release.

Questions about the 140-3 module.

** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

22140: Property queries on algorithms proposal.

There are multiple problems, e.g. granualrity of prop queries for TLS; finer
control of prop queries for composite algorithms; fetching by curve in EC.

We should start by defining the problem and then consider solutions.

22158: Apple DHCAST128 support. We would consider a PR that enabled a settable
minimum length.
