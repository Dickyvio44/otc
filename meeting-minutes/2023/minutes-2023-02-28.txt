** Nominate a minute taker and confirm agenda

Matt volunteered to take the minutes.
Proposed: Matt, seconded: Matthias

Agenda for the meeting agreed. Proposed: Matt, seconded: Tomas

** Agree minutes from previous meeting

Minutes from previous meeting were agreed. Proposed: Pauli, seconded: Matt

** Release discussion

All issues triaged as regressions on the development branch from which
the release is to be done must have a milestone assigned. Regressions
are considered from the previous stable release series. - DONE

All issues or pull requests with the milestone for the release are closed. - DONE

There are no outstanding untriaged Coverity issues - DONE

Coveralls coverage has not decreased overall from the previous release
from the particular development branch. - DONE

The CI must pass on the tip of the development branch before the release
commits are added to the tree, including the daily CI builds. - DONE

The tree must be frozen for at least 7 days. No changes apart from
regression or security fixes should be merged during the freeze. - NOT YET FROZEN

For 2 days before the release there should be no changes to ensure the
daily CI builds run on the development tree tip. - NOT YET DONE

The OTC should explicitly approve that the source is ready for a release
with a vote. - NOT YET DONE

Concerns raised about suprising people with the release. Should we announce the
release first before freezing the tree? Proposal is to do an announcement today
for a release on 14th to openssl-project with freeze on 7th, and a blog post
also on 7th.
AI: Matt to send a 3.1 release announcement today to openssl-project

** Working Group f2f summary

We met as a single group with all OMC except one and all paid resources except
one (exceptions attended some sessions remotely)

We made good progress. Tam is currently writing up notes from the session.

We came up with a draft mission statement and values. Waiting for a couple of
weeks before it goes out for wider comment. Tim presented the current draft.

** Review outstanding security issues

We discussed outstanding security issues.

AI: Tomas to raise public issues for security issues #77, #78
AI: Matt to read #80 and decide whether to follow up with David.

** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

#20229: We cannot revert the current PKCS7 behaviour. We should document the
behaviour better. We could implement better functionality for the future.

#20241: Should there be a build time check for the EMS FIPS check. We should
remove the build time option.

** Review draft technical policies

None

** AOB

Dmitry: We should add the CVE id to all commits that are intended to fix the
CVE. We should distinguish between "fixes" and "related to" the CVE:

Fixes: CVE-XXXX-YYYY
Related-to: CVE-XXXX-YYYY

AI: Richard to add something to the security process about adding CVE ids to
    commits.
AI: Richard to consider if we can make the security process public.

Dmitry: Duplicating of ctx.
AI: Dmitry to add a hold on #20375

Dmitry: presented some callgrind output which shows excessive number of calls.
AI: Dmitry to raise a specific public issue about excessive number of calls in
    callgrind

Shane: Should we be looking at other toolkits to see if there are relevant
changes that we could benefit from?
