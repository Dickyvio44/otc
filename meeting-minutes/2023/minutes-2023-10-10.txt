** Standing invitation to James Muir

OTC extends a standing invitation to James Muir to attend as an external
attendee.

OTC extends a standing invitation by default to all current and future
contractors to attend OTC meetings as external attendees.

** Beta approval

We would like to make a beta release on Thursday.

Remaining concerns:
  - Intermittent evp_test failure
  - QUIC fuzzing
  - VMS failures
  - FIPS compat
  - Header file issue

The intermittent evp_test failures are too serious to allow
beta signoff at this time. QUIC fuzzing is also a priority.

** POSIX Support Policy (Neil)

It would be useful if we could audit the introduction of new OS symbols
in new PRs.

AI: Hugo to create issue about producing infrastructure for auditing OS symbol usage

** Add config option to limit MDs used in signatures (19084)

Defer

** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

#21704: md5: add assembly implementation for loongarch64
    OTC: As this is not an algorithm in the legacy provider, there is no
         need to block this PR.

#22266: It is no longer possible to insert a second identical unsigned attribute
    OTC: We should not revert #21505 but this needs to be investigated and
         possibly a different fix is needed.

#22304: crypto/{CMS,PKCS7,OCSP,TS,X509}: constify cert list parameters; tidy up
app code
    OTC: Adding or removing const for reference is an API break. These changes
         need to be dropped from the PR.

#22296: bio.h syntax error line 993 - openssl-3.2.0-alpha2 - mingw on Wingows -
g++.exe (Rev7, Built by MSYS2 project) 13.1.0
