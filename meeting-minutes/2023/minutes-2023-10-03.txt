AI: Everyone to read Dmitry's Redhat FIPS PRs (#21929, #21928, #21926)
Done

3 coverity issues are open.
Some build failures still.
A PR for coveralls is about to merge that will reduce the coverage number (but
this applies to all branches).
Review of issues to check there are no regressions needs to be done.

AI: Anton to create a ticket to ensure the release checklist is checked before
next OTC meeting

** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

18916: apps/smime: Fix behaviour, doc and option name wrt untursted certs

This is not a bug fix because it is adding a new options. Not applicable to
stable branches currently.

22198: Optimize out uneeded up_ref/free of EVP_CIPHER

[Nicola Tuveri joined the call]

Ok to cherry-pick to 3.1 and 3.0 branches.

22203: key_share /supported_group selection algorithm needs changes for post-quantum

Documentation fix for stable branches + 3.2. Fix for 3.3 to be designed.

22206: feat: support the targetingInformation X.509v3 extension

The structures should be opaque, possibly with accessors. And there should be an
OSSL_ prefix (or some other prefix to be specified by the review process) so the
public symbols aren't potentially conflicting with applications

** Review outstanding security issues

** Review draft technical policies

AI: Tomas to close the assert policy vote.

We need a DTLSv1.3 feature branch

Who is responsible for approving the creation of the branch?
We need a policy for how to manage the branch.
How will rebases of the feature branch be reviewed?

AI: Matt to ask WG about approval of DTLSv1.3 feature branch
AI: Anton to write a policy for feature branches (including how to review rebases)

When to branch 3.2?

The DigestSqueeze API should go into 3.3

We will branch at beta.

Should there be OTC presentation for Richards two design PRs (22129, 22162).
There is no need at this time.

LMS:
This does fit well with the DigestVerifyInit/Final APIs. The signature should be
supplied earlier (before the Update).

AI: Shane to consider LMS API and write a design.
