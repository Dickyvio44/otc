We discussed outstanding security issues.

#67: Allow FIPS compliance fixes to be bug fixes
    To be discussed at next meeting.
    AI: OTC to review draft technical policy on FIPS compliance

** Branch policy deployment

We have already agreed a branch policy but it has not yet been put into
practice.

- Since agreeing the branch policy we have decided to do time-based
  releases with feature branches. Thus the branch policy previously
  agreed does not seem as applicable as previously.

- We should probably revise the branch policy to reflect our new
  approach.

We should not activate the branch policy at this time.
Deferred until the branch policy is reconciled with the implications
of time-based releases.
