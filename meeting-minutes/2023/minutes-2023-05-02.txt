[Nicola joined the call]

- Hotels
    => We should go for the hotel in the city centre. Proximity to DevConf
       is desirable.

** Shining Light/Binaries

- The call with Shining Light was constructive.
- Opening the installer for Windows binaries is possible.

  What repository should installer scripts, etc. be in?
    => Separate repository
    => 'installer' is fine as a name
    => Same review requirements as main repository.

- Binaries are not currently authenticode signed.
  OpenSSL could decide to undertake this.
  We will of course sign with our own official PGP key.

AI: Anton to ensure the 'installer' repository is created

** Possible meeting with provider authors

- Should we have a one-off meeting with provider authors?
- Or ongoing engagement?
    => Infrequent - annual, biannual?

AI: Hugo to draft an email to openssl-project, openssl-users,
    support customers list asking about interest in participating
    in a meeting with provider writers

** Stephen's proposed API for ECH

Stephen will be on the next OTC call to present the proposed ECH API.
OTC will have the opportunity to ask questions.

Proposed API:
    https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/20408

** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

#20580: Add QUIC support to s_client
    SSL_get_tick_timeout: Add third parameter to SSL_get_tick_timeout()
        indicating lack of timeout and make DTLSv1_get_timeout
        work with QUIC

#20580: Add QUIC support to s_client
    SSL_tick: SSL_pump? SSL_handle_events?
        OTC: Rename to SSL_handle_events, and SSL_get_tick_timeout to SSL_get_event_timeout
             Fix all documentation.

OTC: These can be handled in a separate PR and do not block the s_client PR.

AI: Hugo to raise a PR to make these QUIC tick function changes

** Review outstanding security issues

We discussed outstanding security issues.

** Review draft technical policies

None.

** AOB

Should we lower the review requirement for the fuzz-corpora repository?
    e.g. for additions
    e.g. 1 review, no 24 hour delay
    Where to document this?
        README.md of the repo?
        Should consider adding review requirements to README.md of every repo
        Removing test cases still needs second review

AI: Tomas to amend the fuzz-corpora README.md with a new review policy
