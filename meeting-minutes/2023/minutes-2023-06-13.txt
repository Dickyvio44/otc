possible.

Best way to get to the meeting location from the hotel is Tram No. 12.

** Param performance enhancements (Pauli)

https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/20940

We can automatically generate fast param decoders for each unit of code
consuming OSSL_PARAMs.

There is broad consensus in favour of the proposal. It would be nice to
see some performance measurements, perhaps using our new performance
measurement infrastructure.

Target release: post 3.2.

** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

#21011 (TLS: add SSL_writev)
    OTC: OTC concurs with the above writeup.

AI: Hugo to create an issue to track SSL_writev issue after 3.2
Done (#20918, existing issue)

#20781 (configure: introduce no-ecx to remove ECX related feature)
    Whether to backport to 3.1 and/or 3.0 or not?

    OTC: We are disinclined to backport this to 3.0, 3.1. However we
    are open to additional community feedback influencing this decision.

#21067 (Slow response when using the store X509_LOOKUP method)
    Defer

[Tim left the call]

#21124 (Fix BN_nnmod and BN_mod_inverse incorrect result)
    OTC: Do we want to allow aliasing the modulus in modular operations, or just
         error out instead?
    OTC: We should error out instead of making it work for the modulus aliasing
         with result. Documentation should also mention this.

#21187 (fips: use memory ordering rather than locks)
    OTC: OK to backport in 3.1, 3.0.

#21189 (Cherry-pick uefi float related changes to openssl-3.1)
    Should this be backported to 3.1 and 3.0?
    OTC: We are OK with backporting this to 3.1 and 3.0 branches.

#21068 (Unexpected logic for the default store lookup URI)
    OTC: We should revert the changes to the store handling code.
    We can keep the Winstore provider but it would have to be loaded
    explicitly.

** Review draft technical policies
