** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

#20752: fipsinstall: add -pedantic option
    Should this be backported to 3.1 despite being a feature?

    A vote was called:
        "Accept #20752 for backport to 3.1 subject to the usual review process."

#20423: QUIC Congestion Controller
    OTC: This should use OSSL_PARAM(s)

** Review outstanding security issues

We discussed outstanding security issues.

AI: OTC to read Mark's email about CVSS scores

** Review draft technical policies

#67: Allow FIPS compliance fixes to be bug fixes
    - We don't have these arise often enough to need a policy change.
    - We can discuss at OTC and approve exceptions as the conversation
      is helpful.

    OTC: We can handle this by the normal exception process so this is
         being retracted by the proposer.

    It may be brought back at a later date if the exception process becomes a
    problem in future.

#58: New design policy proposal
    Reminder that the vote for this has now opened as of today.
