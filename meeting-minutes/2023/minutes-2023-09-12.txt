** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

#21742: Replace strdup with OPENSSL_strdup
    OTC: Do not use OPENSSL_strdup() here. Please use other standard libc functions.

#21961: Bind provider search property to ssl object
    OTC: This API cannot be added as is.

    As SSL_CTX can contain fetched algorithms, keys, or other things that
    depend on property query, it would be inconsistent to try to override the
    propq on SSL_new(). Could you please give us more information about the
    architecture of the application where having separate SSL_CTX objects for
    separate propqueries is infeasible.

#21964: FIPS RNG
    OTC: The option (3) is the way to go. It should be backported to all
         3.x branches.

         The FIPS lab will be consulted for the impact on the validation.

** Review outstanding security issues

We discussed outstanding security issues.

** Review draft technical policies

#72: Add assert policy
    Received broad support during discussion
    OTC: Add the word 'only' regarding OPENSSL_assert

** AOB

Dmitry has two PRs he potentially wants included in 3.2.
    #21875 - Issue 21826: Add ability to derive primes in EVP_PKEY_fromdata

    OTC: Standard review process with feature freeze at beta.
         We do not need to rush to get this in.
         There could be a separate PR backporting the fixes only.

    #20131 - Allow to pass a passprase callback at store open

    OTC: Standard review process with feature freeze at beta.
         We do not need to rush to get this in.

Shane has raised a PR for SQUEEZE (#21511)

Shane wants to know the lab's position on X25519
    Pauli: Their position is that X25519 and X448 are not approvable
           but they are allowed.

           This is different from our previous interpretation which
           was that they are not approvable.

Hugo, Tomas and Anton will be at ICMC next week.
We are cancelling the OTC meeting next week.

The OTC extends congratulations to Anton for becoming an OMC member.

It would be appreciated if OMC and other status changes were communicated to OTC
and committers earlier.

OTC suggests to OMC that we should have a blogpost about Anton becoming an OMC
member.

When are we doing the 3.2 beta release?
    We can defer this until after ICMC.

If the contractor team decide that an alpha 2 release is appropriate,
this does not need OTC approval. However this is not planned at this
time.
