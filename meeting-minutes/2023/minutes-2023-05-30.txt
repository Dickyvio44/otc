** Technical community engagement strategy

- Roadmap planning and how it interacts with community engagement
  is one aspect

- GitHub Discussions for user questions

- Level of interaction with OpenSSL forks

- Users who we never hear from/can't reach

- Blog posts

- The response we have had to our provider meeting invitation
  has been extraordinary.

  Inviting the community to non-public meetings seems to be
  a successful strategy which may work well for other user
  groups as well.

** OTC F2F meeting agenda

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EHyrFzmWX6F6pLlHQtdg9fN58--mKrTc-NqSWJgdkkI/edit#gid=0

No updates. People have been assigned to slots.

Should there be a short abstract of each topic to be discussed?

AI: Everyone to add abstracts to F2F agenda items, google doc with agenda
    abstracts linked from spreadsheet

AI: Hugo to mail otc@, openssl-committers@ asking them to add abstracts 
    to their agenda items

** Provider meeting

Planning is in progress.

Enormous interest: provider developers, provider users,
    people who want to listen in or learn more, etc.

** Param performance enhancements (Pauli)

Defer

** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

Should the locking performance enhancements be backported to 3.1 and/or 3.0?
    It would not really make sense to backport to 3.0
        as there are other locking fixes in 3.1 we already chose not to backport
        to 3.0.
    3.1 is more of a question but would be against our policy.

    #20927: Slightly risky, probably master only
        OTC: This is too risky for 3.1, 3.0. Master only.

    #20929: Avoid taking a write lock in RAND_get_rand_method
        OTC: Master only as there is some risk involved and the patch is
             invasive.

    #20970: Don't get a lock when querying the parent reseed_count (alternative)
        OTC: As there is little benefit without #20929, master only.

    #20943: When we're just reading EX_CALLBACK data just get a read lock
        OTC: This can go into 3.1.

    #20950: Modify ENGINE_pkey_asn1_find_str()  to use a read lock
        OTC: Master only.

    #20952: Optimise some X509_STORE related locking
        OTC: Low risk, non-invasive, OK for master and 3.1.

    #20953: Optimise locking in rsa_get_blinding()
        OTC: Master only as there is no significant performance benefit.

    #21059: Fix documentation where openssl-genrsa is listed as deprecated since
            OpenSSL 3.0
        OTC: OK to remove the deprecation notice.
