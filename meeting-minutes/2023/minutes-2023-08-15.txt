** PROVIDER_load_ex (Dmitri)

Current proposal implements the simplest option, feeding parameters
to implementation function.

Proposal seems reasonable and can go through standard review process.

Should we support multiple instances of a provider in the same libctx?

What are the requirements for improvements to the provider load interface?

** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

#20754: Optimize SM2 on aarch64
    Is the 512 kB read-only data table acceptable as is or do we
    require a possibility to disable it?

OTC: We need compile-time config option for this that is on by default.
     The increased size of libcrypto also needs to be documented in
     CHANGES.md.

** Review outstanding security issues

We discussed outstanding security issues.

** Review draft technical policies

None.

** AOB

Should we have a design meeting for symmetric keys (EVP_SKEY)?
    Who should be invited to this meeting?
    Should we post it on the mailing list?

    Consensus is no
