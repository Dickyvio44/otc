We discussed outstanding security issues.

** 3.1 beta release

- Ran through the beta 1 release checklist (#19864)
- We should attempt to setup a Coveralls build for 3.0 and 3.1.
- Coverity: Skip requirement for the beta release.
- We should attempt to get Coverity in place before the final
  release.

OTC would accept a local run of lcov to compare the coverage with 3.0 branch if
using Coveralls would be impossible or too difficult.

Vote:
    topic: OTC approves 3.1 beta 1 release on Wed Dec 21 2022 assuming all the
        outstanding items on the release check-list (#19864) are done including
        the provisions for Coverity and Coveralls items as mentioned in the
        check list issue.

** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

#19873: Backport of "Enable brainpool curves for TLS1.3" including later
        improvements [to 3.1]
OTC: This is not within the scope for the 3.1 release so this
     should not be merged.

#19876: Make error reason for disallowed legacy sigalg more specific
        -- Should this go to 3.1?
OTC: No objections to treating this as a bug fix and merging to 3.1 and
