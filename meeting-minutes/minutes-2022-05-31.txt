** Nominate a minute taker and confirm agenda

Tomas volunteered to take the minutes.
Proposed: Tomas, seconded: Matt

Agenda for the meeting agreed. Proposed: Matt, seconded: Matthias

** Agree minutes from previous meeting

Last week minutes were approved.
Proposed: Pauli, seconded: Matt

** Review outstanding actions

AI: Tomas to take the the requirements policy to a vote
Done

AI: Tomas call vote on openssl/technical-policies#7 next week.
Done

AI: Dmitry to populate #18393 (logging API) with some requirements
Done

** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

#16741 - Bernd has some concerns whether this should go into 1.1.1.
AI: Matt to re-check the PR#16741 and present to OTC next time

#18198 - We have a broken OSSL_FUNC_BIO_ctrl upcall using wrong return type
AI: Richard to create a separate PR for fixing OSSL_FUNC_BIO_ctrl with
alternative proposal that would be forward and backward compatible (at least
partially).

#18407 - It's a test framework feature, a vote is required for backport to 3.0.
Vote raised by Nicola: Accept PR#18407 for backfit to 3.0 as a policy exception.
AI: Nicola to create the vote issue for the PR#18407 vote and e-mail according
to the process.

** Review draft technical policies

https://github.com/openssl/technical-policies/pull/50:
Asked Kurt to call the vote or amend the policy.

https://github.com/openssl/technical-policies/pull/51:
AI: Matt to raise the vote on Deprecate long policy change once the 2 weeks
period since opening the PR passes.

** Review and confirm the BIO DGRAM API

Design PR:
https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/18210

Implementation:
https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/18270

OTC selected the design based on three major features:
1. New BIO API calls BIO_sendmmsg, BIO_recvmmsg with public BIO_MSG structure
   that can be later extended via the stride size parameter concept.
2. We will not implement IOVs in the API.
3. On platforms that do not support sendmmsg/recvmmsg the calls will be emulated
   by sendmsg/sendto/recvmsg/recvfrom.

Proposed by: Tomas, Seconded: Matt

AI: Hugo to refine the design document based on the above and the implementation
experience.

** Return values and typedefs

We have multiple types of error returns in functions, how to indicate that
so this is more visible than buried somewhere in the API documentation.

We should add macros to distinguish the various negative return values to
clarify what they mean. These macros might potentially need to be
module-specific.

No volunteer came up to create a proposal of coding style policy change.
Keeping the item on agenda for the next week.
