** Nominate a minute taker and confirm agenda

Tomáš volunteered to take the minutes.
Proposed: Tomáš, seconded: Matt

Agenda for the meeting agreed. Proposed: Matt, seconded: Tim

** Agree minutes from previous meeting

Last week minutes were approved.
Proposed: Matt, seconded: Tomáš

** Review outstanding actions

AI: Matt to update the technical requirements document and start a vote after
two days unless there is a major discussion ongoing on the PR.

Done, please vote

AI: Update the QUIC API proposal with approach to solving the 5 problems
(1) timer based events (2) TCP vs UDP socket creation (3) blocking (4) no visible
event capability for existing apps (5) configure protocol via a string.

Not done, waiting on the demos

AI: Separate out in the API proposal the subset we will implement for MVP.

Not done, waiting on the demos

AI: Matt to extend out the description of SSL_new_stream() to make it clearer that
in the TLS context it creates a new connection.

Done

AI: Tomas to write a draft release requirements policy in the next sprint

Not done

** Review issues with OTC hold (20 minutes)

#17894 - How should we handle Coverity issues when they are false positives. In
general if the workaround is not performance expensive or too ugly, we should
do it.

#17937 - How to handle the deprecations of OPENSSL_LH_stats functions as that
generates warnings when using DEFINE_LHASH_OF. Postponed to next week to review
alternative proposals.

#17973 - Should we backport the sparse array size change to 3.0?
AI: Pauli to call a vote on the sparse array size change backport.

#17978 - ecparam handling in fips module - the bug fix in the ec_export() is OK
for master and 3.0. We should change the behaviour in master to disallow
import of arbitrary explicit parameters into the fips module.

** Discuss the demo driven development proposal

Hugo presented his proposed set of demos that should be representative of apps
that use OpenSSL for TLS.

There were various ideas where should these API reference implementations
live in the OpenSSL source tree.

AI: Hugo to create a PR against the OpenSSL source tree which adds the demos
in the tree.

Once the PR is in we will hold a vote on whether these demos are representative
of the major usage patterns of libssl.

AI: Hugo to write a blog post about the demos and their relation to the QUIC
API design.

** Review draft technical policies

AI: All to re-read the branch policy proposal.

#36 - Simple policy edits policy
Richard opened this policy proposal. There was an idea to merge this into the
policy for technical policy changes.

AI: Tomáš to create an alternative proposal that amends the policy change
process policy

#33 - Switch to C11 instead of C89/90
If anyone wants to propose this change he needs to create a PR against coding
style policy with the proposal. 

** Allocation of tasks to contractors

No change.

** Agree agenda for next meeting

    * Agree minutes from previous meeting

** AOB

Dmitry presented the problem of dropping real errors happenning when
decoding fails in some particular decoder.

AI: Dmitry to open an issue that will show the concrete problems where
real errors from decoders are dropped.

Nicola reported that he won't be able to complete the testcases for the
PR #16624.

AI: Matt to ensure https://github.openssl.org/openssl/openssl/issues/72
is scheduled for the next sprint.
