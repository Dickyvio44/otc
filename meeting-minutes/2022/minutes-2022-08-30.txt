code
Not done. Matt's not anticipating to get it done sooner than after a month,
volunteers welcome.

** Review outstanding security issues

We discussed outstanding security issues.

** Congestion of PRs needing reviews

Matthias presented that we have many pending PRs that are stalled waiting for
reviews.

Tim suggested planning a PR backlog review sprint(s).

We should also gather some statistics on whether the queue grows especially
for externally contributed PRs. Also whether there are PRs that waiting
_forever_ to get a review.

We need these metrics to find out what are the priorities and how to improve
the situation.

AI: Martin to propose some metrics on outstanding GH PRs and issues.

** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

#19072 - ERR: Adapt ERR_raise() calls after making CRYPTO_malloc() and friends
report ERR_R_MALLOC_FAILURE

We need a proposal with the alternatives how to handle this.

AI: Richard to propose alternatives for what to do with the duplicate
ERR_raise() calls right after failed OPENSSL_*alloc() and also the ERR_raises
after the other _new() call failures.
