** Security issues

Current security issues were discussed and severity assigned.

Discussion about possible changes to the security policy.

** Locale issues

The consensus is that 18039 is a bug that needs fixing in 3.0

Discussion about whether OPENSSL_strcasecmp() should be made public API in 3.0.
The biggest stability risk is fixing the bug. Exposing the API is low risk and
is very likely to be required by provider authors.

API in 3.0
