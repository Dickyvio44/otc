** Review outstanding security issues

We discussed outstanding security issues.

** 3.1 Alpha Release

Plan is to release on 1st Dec

This timing may be tight but if done later the delays
would be substantial due to the Christmas holidays

The purpose of the alpha is to obtain feedback from
the community

Decision: We are still aiming for the 1st Dec but we
can defer this at the time if we feel we are not ready.

    OTC: We want at least a one-off test run on a AVX512_IFMA capable machine to
