** HPKE 

Stephen gave an introduction to HPKE.

Primary differences between the two PRs are the public API and the DHKEM in the
providers. 3 stages were proposed: 1) define the extended internal KEM API
2) Implement DHKEM in the provider 3) Implement HPKE

Discussion is that we would use Stephen's PR as the basis for the HPKE
implementation - but use Shane's provider based KEM implementation.

The external API should be evolved to be closer to the RFC API.

Possibly we could restrict to just the base mode initially. However the API
would have to be flexible enough to cover all modes.

Decision:
 1) We will use Stephen's PR as the basis for the HPKE implementation
 2) The public API needs to be evolved to be closer to the RFC
 3) We will use the provider based DHKEM implementation from Shane's PR

Discussion about making the KEM implementation not specific to EC.

** Review outstanding security issues

We discussed outstanding security issues.

** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

#8136: Should there be a leading 0 when printing a BIGNUM? There is a
difference between printing the DER encoding and printing the actual value.
Because the removal of the leading zero might possibly break third party scripts
and it is not seen as too confusing given the DER encoding contains the zero
anyway we do not want to accept this into 3.1

#14833: Make CRYPTO_malloc() and friends report ERR_R_MALLOC_FAILURE. There
will be "double" malloc error reports as a result of this PR. The current state
of the PR is not acceptable becuase it possibly reports error on 0 bytes
allocated. This PR can be merged if there will be a followup PR to fix the
duplicated ERR_raise(ERR_R_MALLOC_FAILURE) calls in one way or another - depending
on the context.

#15905 Enable some disabled __owurs. This is OK to go in 3.1

#17662: Discussion about how this works. Further dicussion deferred.
