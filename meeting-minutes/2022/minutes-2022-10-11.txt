** Review outstanding security issues

We discussed outstanding security issues.

** RIPEMD160

There was a discussion whether it was a mistake to remove RIPEMD160 in 3.0. The
question now is what to do about it. We have a proposed fix which additionally
makes RIPEMD160 available in the default provider.

OTC refer the issue to OMC for a decision. An OMC hold has been placed on the
PR (#19375). Also see issues #17722 and #16994.

** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

#17984 disable 5x interleave on buffers shorter than 512 bytes

Discussion about whether this should be backported to 3.0 or not.

OTC Vote:
OTC considers PR#17984 as a bug fix and therefore can be backported to the 3.0 branch

AI: Matt to create issue for the OTC vote on PR#17984

#18864 Should libctx be added to the OSSL_set_max_threads() and
OSSL_get_max_threads() functions?

The consensus is that, yes, we should add libctx to those functions

#19248 Loading a config file with SSL/TLS config overwrites config from another OSSL_LIB_CTX

Fixing this could be breaking. A partial fix might be that loading the config into
the NULL libctx sets the global default values. Otherwise loading config into a
specific libctx will apply onto to that libctx.

The partial fix is still not perfect.

The partial fix is the preferred approach and should be applied to 3.0. We can
consider changing this for 4.0.
