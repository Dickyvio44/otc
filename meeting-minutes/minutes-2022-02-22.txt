** Review outstanding actions

AI: Matthias to submit a PR to change https://www.openssl.org/policies/otc-policies.html
    (Issue #3 in otc repository on GHE)
In progress

AI: Staff to think about and eventually add testing of 3.0 FIPS provider against
master libcrypto and master FIPS provider against the 3.0 libcrypto.
    (Issue #2 in otc repository)
Done

AI: Pauli to start the vote on code style policy update after 9th Feb
Done

AI: Matt to separate out the requirements in the Technical Requirements document
    into the releases they are relevant for.
Done

AI: Pauli raise vote on technical policy #21
Done

** Side channel mitigations

A report about some side channel attacks and mitigations was received. This issues
not a CVE. Should we incorporate the migitgations anyway?
AI: All of OTC to read the document in https://github.openssl.org/otc/security/issues/2

** PSK and SECLEVEL

https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/17743
The definition of the SECLEVELs is here:
https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html

#17743 is probably just a bug that should be fixed.
AI: Nicola to investigate the forward secrecy of the TLS1.2 PSK ciphersuites (#17743)

** Performance

Issue discussed with property query string being NULL instead of "" causes the
code to go down a slower code path
AI: Pauli to raise a PR to fix query string being NULL issues

OSSL_LIB_CTX locking is an issue. Proposal to pre-allocate the locks rather
than lazily initialise them.
AI: Pauli to raise an issue to put fixing the OSSL_LIB_CTX locking issue in the
backlog

** Review draft technical policies

PR#7: No update

PR#24: Clarify the definition of stable release
AI: Richard to update technical-policies PR#24 following feedback

PR#27: Add links to the glossary
Still needs to wait until 2 weeks are up for the vote to start. This only changes
links not the meaning of the policies.

** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

#17408: Reviewed previously. We didn't remove the hold. Now done.

#17493: Should we mark parameters with an "optional" marker?
We won't do this.

#17577
AI: OTC members to read the techical requirements document (#17577)

#17590: Oversized EC co-ordinates. Should we reject them?
This is a breaking change. Not for 3.0 or 1.1.1. Postpone the decision until 4.0.

#17627 Performance problems
AI: Pauli to propose what performance fixes should be included in 3.1

#17655 Changing N_WORDS to NUM_WORDS in the ige code.
This won't be included.

#17722 RIPMD160 problematic
We will not change this for 3.x. We can revist this for 4.0.

** Allocation of tasks to staff
As before

** Agree agenda for next meeting

    * Nominate a minute taker and confirm agenda
    * Agree minutes from previous meeting
    * Review outstanding actions
    * Review the technical requirements document
    * Review draft technical policies
    * Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

** AOB

What do we do with algorithms that are deprecated during the FIPS lifecycle?
We can do this via security policy.

Question about the workflow for merging to various repositories. Could we use
the green "merge" button for technical-policies? Currently the PRs are raised on
public github, but the repository is master in GHE.
addrev is only required on the main source code repo.

We will be using Tomas's link next week.
