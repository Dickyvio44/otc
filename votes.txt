topic: Rename OPENSSL_CTX to OSSL_LIB_CTX (as proposed by pull request #12621)

       The main rationale behind this change is consistency, because many of the new
       OpenSSL 3.0 types have an OSSL_ prefix, and OPENSSL_CTX is a notable exception.
       More details can be found in the description and thread of pull request #12621.

       There was a discussion on openssl-committers ('Rename OPENSSL_CTX to OSSL_WHAT?')
       and an initial poll on doodle about the favourite replacements for OPENSSL_CTX
       (https://doodle.com/poll/drku9ziwvkp6tw25).

topic: For change requests which target both the master and the
       OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable branch, the following procedure should be followed:
       - First, a pull request needs to be opened against the master branch for
       discussion. Only after that pull request has received the necessary
       amount of approvals, a separate pull request can be opened  against the
       OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable branch.
       - A separate pull request against the OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable branch is
       required. This holds - contrary to common practice - even if the change
       can be cherry-picked without conflicts from the master branch. The only
       exception from this rule are changes which are considered 'CLA: trivial',
       like e.g. typographical fixes.

comment: #11577 reduces the maximum length of TLS labels.
         It also breaks standards compliance.
